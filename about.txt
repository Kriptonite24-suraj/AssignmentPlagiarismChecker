🧠 Project Title:
Online Assignment Plagiarism Checker Using AI

🎯 Objective:
To develop an AI-based plagiarism detection system that allows students or evaluators to check assignment originality by comparing submitted text or files against an evolving internal database of previously submitted content.

🛠️ Tech Stack:
Component	            Technology Used
Programming Language	    Python
Web Framework	            Flask
Frontend	                HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap
Database	                SQLite
File Handling	            PyPDF2, python-docx
Plagiarism Logic	        Custom Python logic with NLP techniques
Deployment	                Localhost (can extend to cloud)

📌 Core Features:
1. Dual Input Method:
Users can paste text directly or upload .txt, .pdf, or .docx files.

2. File Extraction and Content Parsing:
Uploaded files are read using appropriate parsers:

txt: Plain read

pdf: PyPDF2

docx: python-docx

3. Plagiarism Detection:
Checks input against:

Initial benchmark assignments

Previously stored original submissions in the database

4. Database Integration:
Stores:

Filename (or “Pasted Text”)

Raw content

Plagiarism result

Timestamp

5. Smart Growth:
Only original submissions are saved to the database.

Over time, the database grows automatically, improving plagiarism detection accuracy.

6. Result Reporting:
Clearly shows:

Match percentage

Source file (if matched)

Or a “No significant match found” message if original

✅ Current Protections:
Blank/invalid submissions are ignored and not stored.

Files are securely uploaded and parsed.

Uploads are restricted to safe extensions.

🚀 Future Scope (Optional Enhancements):
Sentence-level similarity detection using NLP (like spaCy, BERT)

User login system for students and teachers

Admin dashboard to view/download past checks

PDF export of results


You can generate this yourself after installing packages with:


pip freeze > requirements.txt
But I included key ones you need.

# Assignment Plagiarism Checker

A Flask web application to detect plagiarism in student assignments by comparing input text or uploaded files (txt, pdf, doc/docx) against a stored dataset and past submissions.

## Features

- Paste assignment text or upload `.txt`, `.pdf`, `.doc`, `.docx` files for plagiarism checking.
- Uses simple text matching to find similarities.
- Stores submissions and results in SQLite database.
- View submission history with timestamps and filenames.
- Clean and responsive Bootstrap-based UI.

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd plagiarism-checker
(Optional but recommended) Create a virtual environment:
