Assignment: Artificial Intelligence (AI) Basics

1. What is Artificial Intelligence? Explain with examples.
Answer: AI is when machines perform tasks that typically require human thinking, such as problem-solving or learning. Examples are virtual assistants and automated vehicles.

2. Describe the differences between weak AI and strong AI.
Answer: Weak AI focuses on a single task like translation, while strong AI would have general intelligence similar to people.

3. What are the main components of an AI system?
Answer: They include datasets, algorithms, computational power, and the ability to improve through feedback.

4. Explain the concept of machine learning and how it relates to AI.
Answer: Machine learning is a technique used in AI that allows systems to improve their performance based on data.

5. What are the key differences between supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning?
Answer: Supervised learning uses labeled data, unsupervised uses unlabeled data to group or cluster, and reinforcement learns through feedback from actions.

6. Describe some real-world applications of Artificial Intelligence in daily life.
Answer: AI shows up in personalized ads, speech recognition, gaming, and smart appliances.

7. What are the ethical concerns and challenges associated with AI?
Answer: Main concerns are job loss, discrimination, privacy, and ensuring accountability.

8. How does Natural Language Processing (NLP) work in AI systems?
Answer: NLP processes and understands human language to enable tasks like translation and chatbots.

9. Explain the role of computer vision in Artificial Intelligence.
Answer: It helps AI systems analyze visual content for tasks like face recognition or quality inspection.

10. What is the future of AI, and how might it impact jobs and society?
Answer: AI is expected to transform industries, enhance productivity, but also poses challenges to employment and ethics.
