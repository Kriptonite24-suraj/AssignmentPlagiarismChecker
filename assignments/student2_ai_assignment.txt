Assignment: Artificial Intelligence (AI) Basics

1. What is Artificial Intelligence? Explain with examples.
Answer: AI is the ability of machines to mimic human intelligence like learning and problem-solving. For instance, Google Maps, chatbots, and facial recognition systems are examples of AI.

2. Describe the differences between weak AI and strong AI.
Answer: Weak AI focuses on particular tasks, like virtual assistants or game AI, while strong AI would have general intelligence similar to humans, which is still theoretical.

3. What are the main components of an AI system?
Answer: AI systems consist of data, algorithms, hardware for computation, and a feedback loop to improve performance over time.

4. Explain the concept of machine learning and how it relates to AI.
Answer: Machine learning allows machines to learn from past data and improve automatically, making it a crucial part of AI development.

5. What are the key differences between supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning?
Answer: Supervised learning trains on labeled data, unsupervised learning identifies patterns in unlabeled data, and reinforcement learning learns by interacting with the environment and receiving feedback.

6. Describe some real-world applications of Artificial Intelligence in daily life.
Answer: We use AI in recommendation engines, digital personal assistants, voice recognition, spam filtering, and smart home automation.

7. What are the ethical concerns and challenges associated with AI?
Answer: Bias, discrimination, privacy concerns, and unemployment are some of the ethical challenges linked to AI technologies.

8. How does Natural Language Processing (NLP) work in AI systems?
Answer: NLP helps AI understand human language using processes like text analysis, sentiment detection, and language translation.

9. Explain the role of computer vision in Artificial Intelligence.
Answer: Computer vision enables AI to process images or video to identify objects, detect faces, and analyze scenes, useful in healthcare and security.

10. What is the future of AI, and how might it impact jobs and society?
Answer: AI will continue to grow, possibly changing how we work, automate many tasks, and even create new job roles, while also raising concerns about job loss.
