Assignment: Artificial Intelligence (AI) Basics

1. What is Artificial Intelligence? Explain with examples.
Answer: Artificial Intelligence is when computers perform tasks usually needing human intelligence, like playing chess or recognizing speech.

2. Describe the differences between weak AI and strong AI.
Answer: Weak AI is designed for a narrow task, like spam detection, while strong AI would think and reason like a human, which hasn’t been achieved yet.

3. What are the main components of an AI system?
Answer: Important parts include data, algorithms, processing power, and feedback mechanisms.

4. Explain the concept of machine learning and how it relates to AI.
Answer: Machine learning is an AI approach where systems improve automatically by learning from data.

5. What are the key differences between supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning?
Answer: Supervised learning uses examples with known answers, unsupervised finds hidden patterns, and reinforcement learns through rewards or penalties.

6. Describe some real-world applications of Artificial Intelligence in daily life.
Answer: AI is used in navigation apps, online shopping suggestions, automated customer service, and fitness tracking.

7. What are the ethical concerns and challenges associated with AI?
Answer: Ethical concerns include bias in algorithms, misuse of personal data, and the threat to jobs.

8. How does Natural Language Processing (NLP) work in AI systems?
Answer: NLP allows computers to read, understand, and respond to human language.

9. Explain the role of computer vision in Artificial Intelligence.
Answer: Computer vision enables AI to “see” and interpret images, important for tasks like object recognition and autonomous driving.

10. What is the future of AI, and how might it impact jobs and society?
Answer: AI could revolutionize industries, boost efficiency, and create new roles, but it also risks replacing certain jobs.
