Assignment: Artificial Intelligence (AI) Basics

1. What is Artificial Intelligence? Explain with examples.
Answer: AI is the process of making computers act like humans, such as understanding speech or making decisions. Examples include self-driving cars and chatbots.

2. Describe the differences between weak AI and strong AI.
Answer: Weak AI specializes in one task, while strong AI would be able to understand and perform any intellectual task a human can do.

3. What are the main components of an AI system?
Answer: Key components are input data, algorithms to process it, hardware for computation, and mechanisms to learn and adapt.

4. Explain the concept of machine learning and how it relates to AI.
Answer: Machine learning lets AI systems get better at tasks by learning from data rather than following hard-coded rules.

5. What are the key differences between supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning?
Answer: Supervised learning uses labeled examples, unsupervised finds structure in unlabeled data, and reinforcement learns through interaction and rewards.

6. Describe some real-world applications of Artificial Intelligence in daily life.
Answer: Examples include Netflix recommendations, voice assistants, smart cameras, and fraud detection.

7. What are the ethical concerns and challenges associated with AI?
Answer: Challenges include algorithmic bias, lack of privacy, unemployment, and the need for regulations.

8. How does Natural Language Processing (NLP) work in AI systems?
Answer: NLP allows machines to interpret human language to answer questions, translate text, or summarize information.

9. Explain the role of computer vision in Artificial Intelligence.
Answer: Computer vision enables machines to process visual inputs like photos or video to detect and classify objects.

10. What is the future of AI, and how might it impact jobs and society?
Answer: AI will bring major changes, improving many areas but also raising concerns about job losses and fairness.
